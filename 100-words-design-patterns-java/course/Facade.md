### Story 


Facade hides the complexity of the system and provides an interface to the client from where the client can access the system.

You want to organize a marriage reception with dinner for 100 people. 
So in order to organize such event, you need to find and decorate a hall where the event will happen, 
then you need to find a music, organize flowers, send invitations and so on and so on.

If this is to much for you than you can find event manager which will organize event for you. 

This is a typical example for Facade.
