# State

### Story 


Behavior depends on its state.

Pregnancy is time of great physical and emotional change for women. 
Everything from the size of her belly to the speed at which her heart beats will change over the nine months leading up to childbirth. 
Partly the result of hormonal fluctuations and partly the physical strain of carrying extra body weight, pregnant women can expect to buy new bras, 
search for ways to alleviate swollen ankles, gasp for breath after climbing a few stairs, and marvel at how quickly their nails grow.
