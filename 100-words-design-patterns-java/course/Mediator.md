### Story 


Defines an object that controls how a set of objects interact.

Radio Taxi is an example of the Mediator pattern.
Taxi drivers communicate with the Mediator(Radio Taxi Call Center), rather than with each other. 

When customer needs a taxi, he calls Radio Taxi Call Center. 
All taxis have a GPS unit which tells where the taxi is present right now, also there is a central information system which tells which taxi is available to serve the customer. 
The call center will contact the available taxi nearest to customerâ€™s location and send them to serve the customer.
